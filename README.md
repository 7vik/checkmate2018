This is the repo for the game for BITS-ACM event Checkmate, 2018. It contains interactive puzzles which one needs to solve in order to gain points. Checkmate was an official BITS-ACM Event conducted in IPC, BITS Pilani on 8th September, 2018. It was a successful event, with more than 200 participants. Everyone received a certificate with their scores, and the winners got a cash prize of 6000 INR.
